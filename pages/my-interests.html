          Currently playing Bloons Tower Defense 6, Graveyard Keeper, and Factorio. I also really like the Sims 4! Mods make it so much better. And I love the Witcher 3 and XCOM 2, but putting them off for now because my laptop can barely run them.

          For boardgames, my favourite is Spirit Island! I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind thinking hard for a bit. It's co-op too, and that's a definite bonus for me. I also own Everdell and Terraforming Mars, and I love them both.
