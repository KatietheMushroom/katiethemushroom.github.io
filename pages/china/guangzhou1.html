            <h3>22 Mar, 2023</h3>

            The 25 hour journey was tough. And no, I don't know why it took so long either. I at least was able to enjoy the front camera view on the first plane in the dawn.

            <div class="img-container">
                <img src="../../images-china/1-emirates.jpg" alt="plane's front camera view" style="width:80%"/> <br> <br>
                <p>Front camera view.</p>
            </div>

            I technically got there on the night of the 21st, I think. I panicked about NordVPN not working, then went to sleep. We started the first full day with a bang, aka some dimsum from a fancy hotel, 花园酒店. 

            <div class="img-container">
                <img src="../../images-china/1-dimsum.jpg" alt="dimsum selection" style="width:95%"/> <br> <br>
                <p>Selection of dimsum.</p>
            </div>

            We were able to find a VPN that works, so the rest of the day was less stressful. As I was promised some shopping, mum & co. took me to a shopping center. I don't know how to describe the function of the place but they just had...things. You're meant to buy things wholesale there and resale them, I think. I went on a little shopping spree for stickers, and also saw many other cute things. Cute things seem to be very popular in China (though you'd think they would be anywhere!).

            <div class="img-container">
                <img src="../../images-china/1-sticker-shop.jpg" alt="sticker shop!" style="width:90%"/> <br> <br>
                <p>kt in the sticker shop.</p>
            </div>

            Gatcha boxes, or blind boxes, seem popular in particular. I have (mostly) refrained from buying into them, though I can see the appeal. 

            <div class="img-container">
                <img src="../../images-china/1-piggy.jpg" alt="piggy models" style="width:90%"/> <br> <br>
                <p>Piggies! These are things you can get from this blind box series.</p>
            </div>

            I also saw this car sticker, which I thought was funny. 

            <div class="img-container">
                <img src="../../images-china/1-irritable.jpg" alt="car sticker" style="width:80%"/> <br> <br>
                <p>我也相当暴躁。</p>
            </div>

            Time for dinner. This place's menu was badly optimised but I forgave them as soon as they brought the food. This is meant to be actual local cuisine, and ant's most anticipated meal (though he's not here yet).

            <div class="img-container">
                <img src="../../images-china/1-baozaifan.jpg" alt="rice in pot" style="width:90%"/> <br> <br>
                <p>This was really good!</p>
            </div>

            Ending the day on a high, we queued at a famous local dessert place. I also took a photo with their huge menu. Did you know they were hiring exclusively female cooks between the age of 18-45 for about £2 an hour?

            <div class="img-container">
                <img src="../../images-china/1-chinese-desserts.jpg" alt="desserts of guangzhou" style="width:70%"/> <br> <br>
                <p>Desserts. They look underwhelming but were pretty decent.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="img-container">
                <img src="../../images-china/1-menu.jpg" alt="menu outside dessert shop" style="width:90%"/> <br> <br>
                <p>We had to wait for people to clear to get a photo.</p>
