            Over Easter 2023, I went back to China for the first time in four and a half years. It was fun but stressful, because I also had about four courseworks I needed to do and no access to Google. Regardless, I figured I'd put together a blog post about it, so that's what you're reading right now. Feel free to jump between chapters using the navigation buttons on the left, or return to the home page with the button in the bottom right corner. 

            <h2 id="guangzhou1">广州 &nbsp;<span class="h2sub">GuangZhou pt.1</span></h2>
            <h3>22 Mar - 27 Mar</h3>

            <div class="img-container">
                <img src="../images-china/1-sticker-shop.jpg" alt="kt in sticker shop" style="width:90%"/> <br> <br>
            </div>

            I was very excited to be back for the first time. Basically easily amused by anything and everything, I partook in admittedly excessive amounts of shopping and indulging in local (not really) food. Here's me being absolutely fascinated by <a href='china/guangzhou1.html'>stickers</a>.

            <h2 id="jilin">吉林 &nbsp;<span class="h2sub">JiLin</span></h2>
            <h3>27 Mar - 3 Apr</h3>

            <div class="img-container">
                <img src="../images-china/2-jilin.jpg" alt="jilin out of car window" style="width:70%"/> <br> <br>
            </div>

            <a href='china/jilin.html'>JiLin</a> had a lot less to do than GuangZhou, but it was exciting none the less. I got to visit Grandpa and both aunts. We once again had a lot to eat, which does seem to be a trend for this trip.
            
            <h2 id="zaozhuang">枣庄 &nbsp;<span class="h2sub">ZaoZhuang</span></h2>
            <h3>3 Apr - 6 Apr</h3>

            <div class="img-container">
                <img src="../images-china/3-station.jpg" alt="train station at jilin" style="width:95%"/> <br> <br>
            </div>

            After visiting dad's side of the family, me and ant (brother) hopped on the 9hr train to ZaoZhuang to visit <a href='china/zaozhuang.html'>mum's side</a>. We only stayed there for three days, and not much happened here.
            
            <h2 id="shanghai">上海 &nbsp;<span class="h2sub">ShangHai</span></h2>
            <h3>6 Apr - 9 Apr</h3>

            <div class="img-container">
                <img src="../images-china/4-disney.jpg" alt="disneyland!" style="width:90%"/> <br> <br>
            </div>

            We would have gone back to GuangZhou, but mum wanted to meet a friend who is almost as busy as she is. So we went to ShangHai for a few days. Not that I'm complaining - we did get to go to <a href='china/shanghai.html'>Disneyland</a>.
